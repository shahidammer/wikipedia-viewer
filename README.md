# Build A Wikipedia Viewer

This is a repo in order to push your code regarding the Front end project you need to do using cool technologies such as 

- ReactJS
- Redux
- React Router

etc.

## Instructions on pushing the code

We are having a change here, For the previous repos you used to create separate
repos, but from now on you'll be using a different flow to push your code. There
will be only one repository for the projects specified by us and you will work 
on a branch created under that repository using your username. This has 
some benefits for the purpose of code reviews, we need to provide you as 
we can then initiate a PR for your request and review your code line by line 
and provide commnets on the line, instead of creating an issue for your repo.

Take a look at this [**gDoc**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jdtVNMiW7Ks_1PmrB4Q5IfXplYJ6A2RzMtFKmXXv-qY/edit#)
in order to learn more about the new flow and how to do it.
